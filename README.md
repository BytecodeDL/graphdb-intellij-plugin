# Graph Database plugin for IntelliJ Platform

This plugin adds support for graph databases to the IntelliJ IDEA platform.
At the moment, the only supported database is Neo4j.

This is a fork of the [Graph Database Support](https://github.com/neueda/jetbrains-plugin-graph-database-support)
plugin, originally developed by developed by [Neueda Technologies](http://technologies.neueda.com/).

The original plugin has not been updated for a long time and does not work with new versions of
IntelliJ and Neo4j.
