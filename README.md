# Graph Database plugin for IntelliJ Platform

This plugin adds support for graph databases to the IntelliJ IDEA platform.
At the moment, the only supported database is Neo4j.

The plugin provides useful developer features for working with graph databases, such as:
* syntax highlighting and autocompletion for 
the [Cypher](https://opencypher.org/) query language
* connecting to and querying local and remote graph databases.

This plugin is maintained and developed in my free time as a personal project,
for no commercial reasons.
Contributions and donations are welcome! Please see the [Getting involved](#Getting involved)
section for more information on how to contribute to this project. 

## Installation

The plugin can be installed directly within an IntelliJ IDEA-based IDE.
Within the IDE, open Preferences then navigate to the Plugin section and search for 'Graph Database'.

Alternatively, you can navigate to the [plugin homepage](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20417-graph-database)
on the JetBrains marketplace and click on the 'Install' button.

## Attributions

This plugin is based on the
[Graph Database Support](https://github.com/neueda/jetbrains-plugin-graph-database-support)
plugin, originally developed by [Neueda Technologies](http://technologies.neueda.com/).

The original plugin has not been updated for a long time and does not work with recent versions of
IntelliJ and Neo4j.
