updater.title=Graph Database plugin updated to v{0}
updater.notification=Initial release of Graph Database Plugin.<br/>\
This plugin is based on the 'Graph Database Support plugin' \
developed by Neueda Technologies, Ltd. The original plugin has not been updated \
in a long time. <br/>\
<br/>\
This plugin has been updated to run with modern versions of IntelliJ and related IDEs. \
Just like the original plugin, it supports Neo4j and Cypher data sources; however, support for \
Gremlin data sources (such as Cosmos DB) has been dropped. \
<br/>\
